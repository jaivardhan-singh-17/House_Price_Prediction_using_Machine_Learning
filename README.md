House_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning

Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house prices through machine learning techniques. It utilizes the well-known California House Pricing Dataset, which is readily available in the scikit-learn library.

Tools and Libraries Utilized:
scikit-learn (sklearn): Employed for implementing various machine learning algorithms and preprocessing methods.
NumPy: Utilized for performing numerical computations and array manipulation.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Utilized for data visualization, including plotting graphs and histograms.
Heatmap and Correlation Matrix: Utilized for exploring relationships among different features within the dataset.

Evaluation Metrics:
The project employs two primary evaluation metrics to assess the predictive capability of the models:

1) R-squared (R^2) Error: This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Higher R^2 values indicate better predictive performance.
2) Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric calculates the average absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. Lower MAE values signify greater accuracy of the model.
Dataset:
The California House Pricing Dataset comprises various features such as population, median income, median house value, etc., which are utilized to predict the median house value for districts in California.

Implementation:
The implementation includes several key steps:

1) Loading and preprocessing the data.
2) Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.
3) Feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.
4) Training different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.
5) Evaluating the models using R-squared error and Mean Absolute Error.
6) Fine-tuning the models for improved performance.
7) Deploying the best-performing model for making predictions on new data.

Conclusion:
This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques for house price prediction using the California House Pricing Dataset. Model performance is evaluated using R^2 error and Mean Absolute Error, with the best-performing model deployed for prediction. Further enhancements and optimizations can be explored to refine the predictive accuracy of the models.
